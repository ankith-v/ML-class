# The Mode
# The Mode is the value that occurs most often


# When there are two modes it is called "bimodal", 
# when there are three or more modes we call it "multimodal".



# Example: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13
# "13" occurs 6 times, "1" occurs only 5 times, so the mode is 13.


# How to remember? Think "mode is most"




# Example: 3, 7, 5, 13, 20, 23, 39, 23, 40, 23, 14, 12, 56, 23, 29
# In order these numbers are:
# 3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 20, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 39, 40, 56
# In this case the mode is 23.




# Another Example: {19, 8, 29, 35, 19, 28, 15}
# Arrange them in order: {8, 15, 19, 19, 28, 29, 35}
# 19 appears twice, all the rest appear only once, so 19 is the mode.




# Example: {1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 9}
# 3 appears three times, as does 6.
# So there are two modes: at 3 and 6


# Having two modes is called "bimodal".
# Having more than two modes is called "multimodal".




# Grouping
# Example: {4, 7, 11, 16, 20, 22, 25, 26, 33}
# Each value occurs once, so let us try to group them.

# We can try groups of 10:

# 0-9: 2 values (4 and 7)
# 10-19: 2 values (11 and 16)
# 20-29: 4 values (20, 22, 25 and 26)
# 30-39: 1 value (33)
# In groups of 10, the "20s" appear most often, so we could choose 25 (the middle of the 20s group) as the mode.





# What is the mode for the numbers 7, 6, 5, 8, 7, 5, 9, 3, 5 and 4?
# order first: 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9




# What is the mode for the numbers 7, 6, 5, 8, 7, 5, 9, 3, 5 and 7 ?
# order first: 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9



# For the numbers 13, 16, 12, 11, 8, 14, 12 and 18  is median > mean > mode ?
# meann = 13
# mediann= 12.5
# mode = 12      mean>median>







# Python program to demonstrate mode()
# from statistics import mode
# from fractions import Fraction as fr

# # tuple of positive numbers
# data1 = (11, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 2, 5)

# # tuple of negative numbers
# data2 = (-1, -2, -4, -7, -19, -1, 2)

# # tuple of mixed range numbers
# data3 = (-1, 3, -4, 55, 2, 19, 2)

# # tuple of fractional numbers
# data4 = (fr(1,2), fr(44,12), fr(44,12), fr(2,3), fr(10,3))


# print('Mode of positive numbers:', mode(data1))
# print('Mode of negative numbers:', mode(data2))
# print('Mode of mixed range numbers:', mode(data3))
# print('Mode of fractional numbers:', mode(data4))
