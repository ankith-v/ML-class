# Measures of spread describe how similar or varied the set of 
# observed values are for a particular variable

# Measures of spread summarise the data in a way that shows how scattered 
# the values are and how much they differ from the mean value.


# The Range is the difference between the lowest and highest values.

# numbers = 1,3,3,3,4,5,4,5,10
# range = 10 - 1 = 9

# numbers = 1,3,3,3,4,5,4,5,1000
# range = 1000 - 1 = 999





# Examples:
# What is the range for the following set of numbers?
# 15, 21, 57, 43, 11, 39, 56, 83, 77, 11, 64, 91, 18, 37




# What is the range for the following set of numbers?
# 57, -5, 11, 39, 56, 82, -2, 11, 64, 18, 37, 15, 68




# 4
# Jerry recorded the temperature in his room every two hours over a 12 hour period from 
# noon to midnight. The results are shown in the following line graph: What was the range?




# 5
# Olivia wrote a 100 word story.She then counted the number of letters in each word. 
# Her results are shown in the following bar graph. What is the range?




#Range in python
# x = [15, 21, 57, 43, 11, 39, 56, 83, 77, 11, 64, 91, 18, 37]
# x = [57, -5, 11, 39, 56, 82, -2, 11, 64, 18, 37, 15, 68]
# range = max(x) - min(x)
# print(range)
