# The Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are.

# Its symbol is Ïƒ (the greek letter sigma). The formula is easy: it is the square root of the Variance.

# A low measure of Standard Deviation indicates that the data are less spread out, 
# whereas a high value of Standard Deviation shows that the data in a set are 
# spread apart from their mean average values.
